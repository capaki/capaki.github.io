                <p>I have been living in Budapest since last September. I study computer science in Eötvös Loránd University as a Stipendium Hungaricum scholar.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to a small issue called a worldwide pandemic, I can’t really say I’ve experienced Budapest to the fullest. From what I’ve experienced so far though, I can wholeheartedly say I absolutely love Budapest.</p>
                <p>Even though it’s not the biggest in the world, it is the kind of city that makes you happy with its scenery and atmosphere while you’re walking down the street (that’s pretty much all that corona allows).</p>
                <p>Although I am glad about my decision of moving here, I must say that I am waiting for the day everything goes back to normal and I can finally get the chance to see what living in Budapest is really like.</p>

                <p>This one is an easy one. I was born there! ahahaha</p>
                <p>Even though there have been quite a few times I have lived in different places around the world (all of which I love very much), Istanbul has always been my home, the place I returned to. My family, my childhood, the history, the culture, the FOOD… there are so many aspects that make Istanbul what it is for me.</p>
                <p>Contrary to the popular belief, Istanbul is not the capital city of Turkey. Although it is the biggest city with its many tourist attractions and a population close to 20 million.</p> 
                <p>You can hear the laughter of people all day and there’s always something to do. There might be times you curse the city out for its hectic living and fast pace but once you get used to it, you miss it like crazy no matter where you go.</p>

                <p>In 2018, I received a scholarship from the US Department of State as a part of the Kennedy Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program. With this program, I got to spend a year as an exchange student in a small town in Los Angeles county.</p>
                <p>Spending a year in a foreign country with a different culture, being surrounded by people from extremely diverse backgrounds, completely changed my perspective in life.</p>
                <p>After spending my childhood watching Hollywood movies and listening to songs about ‘Going to California’, having the opportunity to visit these places and see them myself was fascinating by itself also.</p>
                <p>The whole experience was something I wouldn’t trade for anything. Guess it’s safe to say that I’m still ‘California Dreamin’.</p>

                <p>I’ve been to the capital of America a total of 3 times, but the trip I had the chance to visit and get to know the city best was during the Civic Education Week in March 2019.</p> 
                <p>I was there for a workshop, which I decided on attending last minute (glad I did!). I got to meet many people and visited places that showed me a different side of America.</p>
                <p>Washington DC is a very small (you can walk from one side to the other) but nicely organised city with lots of museums and attractions. Which is a rare in the US.</p>
